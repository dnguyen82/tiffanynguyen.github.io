#Project : Factors that Influence Students to Choose a University: Project Overview

The goal of this project was to find out which are the most relevant features that students consider choosing their favorite university, besides a high-academic ranking. Some of the essential questions for developing this project are the number of applications, admissions, enrollments, tuition and fees, cost of living on campus, types of degrees offered, and features of the states where universities are located (population and GDP). Students go through the dreaded application and decide which university to attend every year. We can relate to the project. Our own experiences have inspired us to take this project.

#Analysis Questions:
1. If the ranking of a university has primary importance?
2. If universities with the most applications are preferred?
3. How much will tuition play a role in decision-making?
4. Does public or private university matter?
5. Is the low cost of living on campus a factor that attracts students to a university?

#Downloading the dataset:
I used the Kaggle dataset during the project analysis. First, I downloaded the data in a CSV
file to the local system. It includes a wealth of information about American universities in 2018
(that aren't necessarily among the top 10â€“20).

#Reading the Dataset:
Using the read commands in Python, I could better understand the file's data. This is the
primary step in the analysis. I could understand the data in the file better. This is the primary step in the
study.
